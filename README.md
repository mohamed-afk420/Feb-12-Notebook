# Feb-12-Notebook
This week We did lots of work. I also got the link to the Project so now I can show you the images of the bull.
But rght now we're developing it so it doesn't really look like a bull. Just a lot of squares
Anyways here's the images
# Image 1

# Image 3

Those are not all the pieces we're using. the others are just copies for the body of the bull.
